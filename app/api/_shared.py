"""The helpers more than one router needs.

app/api/results.py names an .srt and a subtitled .mp4 with free_path,
app/api/clips.py names a clip with it. The two "where is this job's folder"
answers below are shared the same way: dub.py, results.py and script.py all
ask them. So are the rules for the part of a video a new job keeps
(check_trim, parse_ranges, check_ranges_fit, and cut_to_kept_parts for a dub
and an erase): a dub, an erase and a separation follow the same ones, and the held video's own save
(app/api/downloads.py) reads its kept parts with parse_ranges too. Here
rather than in any one router so no router has to import another.

Both work-dir helpers were app/main.py's until 2026-09-06, read back off it by
the routers' `_main()` seams. Unchanged apart from losing their leading
underscore, now that they are a module's exports rather than one file's
privates.
