"""A video brought to the New project screen: a link fetched into a holding
folder (or a file dropped there), played back from it, then saved whole or as
one stretch -- or handed to a dub by id, so the file is not fetched twice.

the other routers. The stretch cut re-encodes the way clips_cut does (see
app/api/clips.py for why not -c copy); media.cut_video is the other thing,
the in-place trim a dub runs on its own input.
