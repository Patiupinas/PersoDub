"""Erasing the subtitles burned into a video: guessing where they sit, running
the erase as a job, playing the result back, saving it, and handing it on to a
dub.

The ritual is the dub's (app/api/_launch.py), reused rather than rewritten: the
free-space floor, a folder named the same way, input.mp4 copied into it, and
launch_job to make the record and set the work going. What differs is the work
itself -- app/erase_launch.py, one stage and no engine choices -- and the
`kind="erase"` stamped on the record, which is what tells the two apart in the
Projects list, in the boot re-arm and in the routes below.

A video arrives the two ways a dub's does: uploaded, or by the id of a file the
New project screen is already holding (app/api/downloads.py). The last route
hands the erased video back to that same holding area, so "now dub it" opens a
new project on the cleaned file instead of the one with subtitles on it.

The eraser pack is not part of the base install, so every route that would use
it checks first and answers 409 {"reason": "pack_missing"} -- the screen offers
the download; nothing here downloads anything by itself.
