"""The timeline's film strip and sound picture of a video (app/media_preview.py).

`kind` says whose video: "job" is the original a dub was made from (its
input.mp4), "download" the video a new project is holding before it is
dubbed. Plain `def` routes, so the ffmpeg run happens on FastAPI's worker
threads and never holds up the event loop.
