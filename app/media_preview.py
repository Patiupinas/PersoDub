"""The timeline's pictures of a video: a film strip of small frames and the
loudness of its sound, each made once with ffmpeg and kept beside the video.

Two files, named after the video they describe:
  <video>.filmstrip.jpg  N frames of FRAME_W x FRAME_H side by side, evenly
                         spaced over the video (the screen reads N off the
                         image's width)
  <video>.waveform.json  {"rate": values per second, "duration": seconds,
                         "peaks": RMS loudness 0..1}

A kept file is used again only while it is newer than its video, so a video
cut in place (a link job's trim) is described afresh. Written under a
temporary name and renamed, so a reader never sees half a file, and every
ffmpeg run has a time limit scaled to the video.
