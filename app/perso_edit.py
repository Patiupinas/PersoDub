"""Editing a Perso dub on Perso's side, and bringing the result home.

A Perso dub made editable (app/perso_materialize.py) is a folder of local
files, and until now a rewritten line was spoken again by this computer's own
engine -- so the line came back in a different voice. Here the line goes back
to Perso instead: Perso speaks it in the voice it dubbed with, and the new
audio replaces the line's wav in the same folder. Everything after that --
the rebuild, the script table, the timeline, export -- is the code that was
already there, reading the same files.

THE RULE between the two ways of remaking a voice, in one place:

  A job is Perso's to edit until a voice in it is made on this computer.
  From the first such voice on, Perso editing is off for that job and says
  so. The two are never mixed silently: Perso's copy of the project does not
  know about a voice made here, so a later proofread would bring back
  Perso's version of that line and the user's would be gone without a word.

  The other direction is guarded too. A proofread replaces every line with
  what Perso made, so it is refused while a line's words are waiting for
  their voice -- those words exist only here, and would be lost. The one
  exception is a NIGHTINGALE project, where Perso makes no single line's
  voice and a proofread is the only way to have new words spoken: there the
  waiting words are sent to Perso first, and then proofread with the rest.

What was made where is read off two small records in the job's folder:
voice_texts.json (app/dub_script.py: every voice made after the dub, by
whoever) and perso_voices.json (here: the ones Perso made). A line in the
first that is not in the second with the same words was made on this computer.

Nothing in this file logs a line's words.
