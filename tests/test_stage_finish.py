"""The last stage of a local dub (app/pipeline.py _stage_finish), pinned as it is.

It puts the dubbed audio onto the video, checks the length, and only then
throws away the losing voice takes. The order is the point: the takes are
kept until the finished file has passed the length check, so a failure before
that leaves them for a reassembly. ffmpeg itself never runs here -- the three
media helpers and cleanup_takes are replaced with recorders, at the names
app/pipeline.py documents as its seams.
